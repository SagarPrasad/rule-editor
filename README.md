Files here are served at the site root (e.g. `/Systems.xlsx`).

**Systems.xlsx** – The Architecture page loads this file on each visit. After editing `Systems.xlsx` in the project root, copy it here so the diagram reflects your changes:

```bash
cp Systems.xlsx public/
```

Then refresh the Architecture page in the browser.
